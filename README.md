# 100daysofcode

Here are my short code snippets in the #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

My challenges are all short and are at beginner level.

I use solely html, css and vanilla javascript.

The goal is to get used to coding on a daily basis, solving problems and as a result, getting better and better.
